Project 3 for DSC 80

### Here we are trying to answer the question: is the "best" player in any given game, on the winning side?


# Introduction

We are utilizing a large data set of competitive match data from the 2022 season (containing 149,232 rows!) and using a specialized formula to determine the overall highest performing player in each game. The relevent columns we have are:

    - gameid: The specific id for each game (there are over 10,000!)
    - url: The link to the match summery data
    - datacompleteness: Whether the data in the row is complete or missing
    - total cs: The total amount of non-player entities killed
    - result: The result of the match, 1 is win, 0 is loss
    - kills: The total amount of kills
    - deaths: The total amount of deaths
    - assists: The total amount of assisted kills
    - damagetochampions: The total amount of damage dealt to other champions
    - earnedgold: The total amount of gold collected
    - visionscore: The amount of times your actions allowed your time to see otherwise unseen targets
    - damagemitigatedperminute: The amount of damage you healed per minute (to yourself or others)

Answering this question is important as it highlights indivual performance and excellence within the competitive circuit. It motivates players to improve as there is verifyable data that suggests that the best teams thrive off of the best indivudual performers.


# Cleaning and EDA
The steps we took in cleaning our data consisted of first selecting our relevent columns and proceeding to clean those. 


# Assessment of Missingness


# Hypothesis Testing
